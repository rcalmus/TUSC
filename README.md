# TUSC - Transcranial Ultrasound Control
## What is it?
TUSC is an **unofficial, research-focused collection of MATLAB scripts and a graphical user interface** (GUI) for controlling the Sonic Concepts Transducer Power Output (TPO) device.

Support for additional devices may be added in the future.

## Authorship
TUSC was conceived, designed, and implemented by **Dr. Ryan Calmus** (University of Iowa) beginning in 2024 as a standalone software framework for transcranial ultrasound device control.

## Installation and usage
TUSC requires **MATLAB R2022a or later**.
To install:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Place the folder in a directory on your MATLAB path.
3. From the MATLAB command window, run:
```matlab
TUSC
```
## Can I use this in my work?
This software can be used to control a TPO through scripting or the GUI. Please note that this software is intended for **research and development use only** and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Sonic Concepts or any other manufacturer.
